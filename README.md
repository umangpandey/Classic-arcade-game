## Introduction:
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). And, the player should cross over to the other-side without colliding with the moving bugs

### The details are as follows:

- When you are ready to play the game press the `Start` button.
- The player can move *left, right, up* and *down* using the arrow-keys.
- The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.
- Once a player collides with an enemy the player moves back to the start square.
- The goal of the player is to reach the other side to the water. It fetches him _10 points_. 
- In the given time period of *30 seconds*, you have to maximise your score.
- When the player collides with the enemy, you have to _forfeit five points_ too (of course, if score is _0_, this rule does not apply) in addition to returning to original position.
- You can restart the game by pressing the `Visit Again!` button after completing a game.
- So, Go ahead ahead and maximize your score.

**GOOD LUCK!!!**
